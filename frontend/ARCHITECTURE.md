# Application Architecture

## Overview

This frontend application is structured following the Atomic Design methodology, which helps in creating consistent, maintainable, and scalable UI components. The architecture is organized in a hierarchical manner, starting from the smallest units (atoms) to complete pages.

## Component Structure

### Atomic Design Implementation

#### Atoms
Atoms are the basic building blocks - small, reusable components that serve a single purpose:
- `Button` - Base button component with variants
- `IconButton` - Button with only an icon
- `Badge` - Small status indicators
- `Card` - Container for content with header, body, footer
- `StatusIcon` - Icons for connection status
- `MediaIcon` - Icons for media states (audio/video)

#### Molecules
Molecules combine atoms to form more complex UI elements:
- `ConnectionStatusIndicator` - Shows connection status with appropriate icon
- `MediaAccessIndicator` - Shows audio/video access status
- `LoadingScreen` - Loading state with animation
- `EmptyRoomState` - UI when room is empty

#### Organisms
Organisms are complex UI sections composed of molecules and atoms:
- `VideoStream` - Complete video stream display with controls
- `RoomHeader` - Header with room info and status
- `RoomControls` - Control bar with media buttons

#### Templates
Templates define page layouts:
- `RoomLayout` - Main layout for video conferencing

#### Pages
Pages are complete screens in the application:
- `RoomPage` - Main video conferencing page

## Key Technical Features

### State Management
- React Context with Zustand for global state
- Component-level state for UI-specific behavior

### WebRTC Integration
- MediasoupService for WebRTC communication
- Proper handling of media streams and transport

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Proper typing for external libraries

### Component Design
- Consistent props interfaces
- Reusable components with clear responsibilities
- Composition over inheritance

## Best Practices

1. **Component Naming**
   - PascalCase for component names
   - Descriptive names that indicate purpose

2. **File Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Index files for easier imports

3. **Props**
   - Explicit prop types with TypeScript
   - JSDoc comments for all props

4. **Styling**
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Consistent class naming

5. **Reusability**
   - Components designed for reuse
   - Separation of concerns

## Future Improvements

1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for complex features

2. **Accessibility**
   - Enhance a11y support
   - Keyboard navigation

3. **Performance**
   - Memoization for expensive operations
   - Virtualization for large lists

4. **Internationalization**
   - i18n support for multi-language
